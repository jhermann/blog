    "\n",
    "Basically, ‘fpm’ allows you to deploy any software via OS packages,\n",
    "from an installation tree on disk or from already built artifacts specific to\n",
    "the chosen implementation language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage over native tooling is you do not need to know\n",
    "about every minute detail of the involved commands and metafile formats\n",
    "for every platform.\n",
    "In case of Debian, that is at least the “control” and “rules” files,\n",
    "and tools like “buildpackage” and “debhelpers”."

    "## How to install it\n",
    "\n",
    "‘fpm’ is written in Ruby and can thus be installed via `gem install`.\n",
    "But you can also run it with JRuby in a JVM,\n",
    "that you might happen to already have on a host anyway.\n",
    "Using JRuny spares you the headache of juggling multiple Ruby versions\n",
    "and isolating gems against other Ruby applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you package it up that way, it also can be installed on any Linux release\n",
    "because you only need a Java8 JRE installed to run it\n",
    "– no native code involved. \n",
    "You can use the `fpm.sh` script in the\n",
    "[priscilla](https://github.com/jhermann/priscilla) project on GitHub\n",
    "to package ‘fpm’ with itself. As written, it works for Debian derivatives,\n",
    "but should be adaptable to other distros with a few changes\n",
    "(remember, ‘fpm’ makes that easy)."
