Especially when it comes to deploying applications with lots of dependencies, or services needing tight integration with the host (i.e. systemd units). For pure command line tools, [pex](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex) and [shiv](https://github.com/linkedin/shiv) can be a better alternative.\n",

    "* [1and1/debianized-sentry](https://github.com/1and1/debianized-sentry) puts all *sentry.io* 9.x services into one package using systemd as a supervisor, you just need to add a PostgreSQL databasse.\n",
    "* [devpi-enterprisey/debianized-devpi](https://github.com/jhermann/devpi-enterprisey/tree/master/debianized-devpi) allows easy deployment of the *devpi* package repository and proxy. This doesn't get updated that often, it basically chugs along silently on my workstations, speeding up virtualenv creation and allowing off-line work.\n",
